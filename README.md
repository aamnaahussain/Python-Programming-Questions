With so much information online, finding the right resources for revision can be overwhelming. To make it easy, I created this open-source repository, combining theory and coding questions for quick and effective concept review.
This repository includes problems focused on foundational Python concepts, to strengthen understanding of topics and build a solid grasp of the basics.

Topics Covered:
1: Operators
2: Control Flow-1(Conditional Statements)
